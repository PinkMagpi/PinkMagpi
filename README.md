### Me!
  Hi! üê¶ I'm @PinkMagpi (she/her)
  
  I like videogames a lot and the stories they tell, so I started learning to make my own game ideas and because programming felt kinda fun.
  
### What I'm Doing
  
  Not much for now but I'll mostly be learning whatever I feel like and having fun. So i'll see if I do anything here on github.
  
  ***I also have an [account on itch.io](https://pinkmagpi.itch.io/)!***

  I'm currently simply trying to learn about whatever game developing frameworks I find interesting. I've mostly played around with a bit of C#, Lua, Assembly 6502 and Godot for now.
