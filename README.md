###Me!
  Hi! üê¶ I'm @PinkMagpi (she/her)
  I like videogames a lot and the stories they tell, so I started learning to make my own game ideas and because programming felt kinda fun.
###What I'm Doing
  Not much for now but I'll mostly be learning whatever I feel like and having fun. So i'll see if I do anything here on github.
  ***I also have an [account on itch.io](https://pinkmagpi.itch.io/)!***
  I‚Äôm currently learning C++ and SDL2 to try out another language and framework. I've also tried out some other things like a bit of C#, Lua, Assembly 6502 and Godot.
